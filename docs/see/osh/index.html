A Fire Fighting Demonstration is typically a training session where firefighters or other experts demonstrate fire-extinguishing techniques and equipment to a group, often with the goal of educating and preparing a factory's own fire-fighting team or committee. A Fire Drill, on the other hand, is a planned evacuation exercise, typically carried out in a building or facility, in which employees practice exiting the building and assembling at a designated location in the event of a fire. Fire Drill is a part of Fire Fighting Demonstration, it helps to ensure that workers are familiar with the building's emergency evacuation plan and that the plan is effective.</p><p>Therefore, in summary, a Fire Fighting Demonstration is basically associated with inviting the relevant or township fire brigade while a Fire Drill is basically associated with a planned evacuation exercise. General recommendations:</p><h4>Fire Fighting Demonstration</h4><ul><li>Conduct two times or minimum one time in a year.</li><li>Keep all document and photo records including lecturing contents, participants list, meeting minutes, and so on.</li></ul><h4>Fire Drill</h4><ul><li>Conduct 4 times or minimum 3 times in a year.</li><li>Conduct Fire Drill together with the Fire Fighting Demonstration if which is going to be conducted.</li><li>Keep all document and photo records including lecturing contents, participants list (participation should be minimum 70% of the number of total workers), meeting minutes, details of evacuation exercise and so on.</li></ul></div><div class=see-container><h3 id=osh-committee>Occupational Safety and Health Committee (OSH Committee)<i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></h3><p>The employer must employ one Occupational-Safety-and-Health-Officer and establish an Occupational Safety and Health Committee consisting of equal numbers of employer's representatives and workers' representatives in accordance with the requirements of the relevant ministry.</p><a href=# class=legal-reference><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>Chapter 6 of The Occupational Safety and Health Law</a><p>In practice, the provisions in chapter 6 of The Occupational Safety and Health Law are not yet in force.
