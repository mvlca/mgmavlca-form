 &lt;h3 id="h.dh4xewqv4uix"&gt;CV Form&lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;CV Form is the first point to assess how the employer is managing recruitment and employment. Questions in CV Form must not probe into irrelevant personal information. A written undertaking of the worker is usually attached to and saved along with the CV Form. Terms and conditions stated in those written undertaking usually demonstrate practices that are not in compliance with the law.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
