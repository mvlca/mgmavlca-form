 &lt;h3&gt;Temporary Daily Worker&lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The term "&lt;b&gt;temporary daily worker&lt;/b&gt;" has precarious connotation. If the employer appoints the worker without signing an employment contract or intention of offering permanent employment later, that worker is typically referred to as temporary daily worker. It has nothing to do with the &lt;b&gt;training&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;probation&lt;/b&gt; periods by which the employer initiates employment process with the written or oral agreement, or at leas mutual understanding, for permanent employment later.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Occupational Safety and Health</title><link>https://g.mgmavlca.com/docs/see/osh/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 13:20:43 +0630</pubDate><guid>https://g.mgmavlca.com/docs/see/osh/</guid><description>&lt;div class="see-container mt3rem"&gt;

 &lt;h3 id="fire-safety"&gt;Fire Safety&lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The factory must have the followings, not limited to, in proper way.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Leaves</title><link>https://g.mgmavlca.com/docs/see/leaves/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 16:37:36 +0630</pubDate><guid>https://g.mgmavlca.com/docs/see/leaves/</guid><description>&lt;div class="see-container"&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Leave means earned Leave (annual leave), casual leave, medical leave, maternity leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="see-container"&gt;
 &lt;h3 id="earned-leave"&gt;Earned Leave (Annual Leave)&lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;If the worker has completed 12 continuous months of work service, he/she is entitled to 10 continuous days of earned leave (annual leave) during the next 12 months after completion of the said 12 continuous months.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;However, it has become a unanimously accepted industrial practice that the employers pay cash benefits for those earned leave (annual leave) days in stead of leave days.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>See VLCA Recommendations (Old)</title><link>https://g.mgmavlca.com/docs/see/old-see/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 17:36:24 +0630</pubDate><guid>https://g.mgmavlca.com/docs/see/old-see/</guid><description>&lt;div class="warning"&gt;

 &lt;h3 id="h.dh4xewqv4uix"&gt;CV Form&lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;CV Form is the first point to assess how the employer is managing recruitment and employment. Questions in CV Form must not probe into irrelevant personal information. A written undertaking of the worker is usually attached to and saved along with the CV Form. Terms and conditions stated in those written undertaking usually demonstrate practices that are not in compliance with the law.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
